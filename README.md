<h3 align="justify"> <i> Well let's start at the beginning, these illustrations are made by <a href="https://blush.design/collections/EcYTq93px20ptlPRSq1C/tech-life">  Karthik Srinivas </a> and the illustrations are free photos from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/pt-br/"> Pexel </a>. <br><br> So, this is a page made almost entirely with bootstrap, making it naturally responsive, its initial idea is to be a travel service a little different from the existing ones, the texts on the page explain a little better. </i> </h3>

<h3 align="justify"> <i>Maybe the strong point of this page is the animations, some are made by me, but perhaps the most important is to scroll the page from <a href="https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/">AOS Lib</a>, it is very simple to use and the animations are completely fluid. </i> </h3>

<h3 align="justify"> <i>In general, this is a simple project, I already knew about bootstrap but I needed to present it in some on my Github. In the future I would like to make it functional, with login page, Q&A and Know More. See the full project below, or on my <a href="https://italicnich.github.io/bootstrap-template-1/"> Github Pages </a>. </i> </h3>
